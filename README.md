Players must select every card in the level. If a player chooses the same card twice, the game ends immediately. After each pick, the cards in the current level shuffle their positions. The goal is to score as many points as possible.

Players must log into their Google account to play the game. When a player loses, their best results are retrieved from the Firebase database and displayed on the page.
